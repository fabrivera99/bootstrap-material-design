bootstrap-material-design
=========================
If you want to use this great theme without the need of the rest of the examples, you only need the "bootstrap.min.css" and the "material-design-theme.css" in the 'dist/css' folder to make it work.

You only need to call the theme css without the need to add new classes to your existent html.

A great bootstrap theme that recreates material design. For now there are only a few components themed.
